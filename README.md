Summary
----------

Gel4y Webshell is a backdoor that was built using the PHP programming language with the PHP procedural method in stealth mode where the file size is only <20KB, using the [nano shell](https://github.com/22XploiterCrew-Team/Shellmon) method so it easily escapes virus scanning. Every PHP function has been obfuscated to avoid some firewall systems (WAF) blocking some PHP functions that are considered dangerous.
